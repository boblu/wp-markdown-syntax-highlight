WP-Markdown-Code-Highlight
==========================

WP-Markdown-Code-Highlight is a plugin for Wordpress that adds code syntax highlighting to Markdown formatted text. You must have the [PHP Markdown](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/) plugin installed for this to work.

Formatting your code
--------------------

In order to have your code highlighted you need to add a shebang containing the language name as the first line of your code block:

    #!php
    $foo = "bar";

The shebang line will be removed in the formatted code and leave you with highlighted text. This will output:

    <pre class="lang-php"><code><span class="re0">$foo</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="st0">&quot;bar&quot;</span><span class="sy0">;</span></pre></code>    

Adding code settings
--------------------

For example

    #!php[line=1]
    $foo = "bar";

Currently only support the following:

* line: 0(default) or 1

Changing the style
------------------

To create your own code style simply upload it to the `css` directory in the plugin folder and then change the `WP_MARKDOWN_CODE_HIGHLIGHT_CSS` definition at the top of the `markdown_code_highlight.php` file. In the future this will be configurable through the Wordpress admin interface.

Over and above the standard GeSHi CSS classes, WP-Markdown-Code-Highlight adds a language-specific class in the format `lang-{language}` to the &lt;pre&gt; tag that you can use for language-specific CSS styles.
